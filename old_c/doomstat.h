// DESCRIPTION:
//   All the global variables that store the internal state.
//   Theoretically speaking, the internal state of the engine
//    should be found by looking at the variables collected
//    here, and every relevant module will have to include
//    this header file.
//   In practice, things are a bit messy.
//

// We need globally shared data structures,
//  for defining the global state variables.
#include "doomdata.h"

// We need the playr data structure as well.
